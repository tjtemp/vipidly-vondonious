## General

## Feature Engineering
# VarianceThreshold, other stat test

## Data Visualization
# hyperplane feature scatter plot




##feature selection
# feature importnace plot (bar)
# partial dependence plot



##model selection
**score (AIC, BIC, Rsqr, accuracy, recall, precision) comparision
** covariance and confusion matrix
**target comparision
crossval vs. non crossval
nested vs. non_nested


**evalution and metric
correlation heat map
covariance

# t-SNE plot and other manifold learning plot


# Model specified metric plot


# Ensemble - Boosting
# n_iteration vs. normalized loss, error, bias, variance, noise, error rate, deviance
